DATA FILES:
We began by loading in two datasets and metadata generated by Prieto et al. The two datasets are available on NIH’s GEO Accession and are:
“GSE205161_20220525-geo_raw_counts.csv.gz” (raw RNA-seq readcounts). We re-saved this as “rawcounts-final.csv”.
“GSE205161_20220525-geo_deseq_counts.csv.gz” (the authors’ post-filtered readcounts).
The metadata is available on Dryad as: “Clinical_rnaseq.csv”.

These files are also added to the github for convenience.

CODE FILES:
For differential gene expression: "DGE Code - BIO-265-FinalProject Draft LK 031825"
For PCA: "PCA Code - BIO-265-FinalProject Draft 031925"
